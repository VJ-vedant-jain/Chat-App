# Changelog V3.2.0.test

Uploaded on 12 April, 2025.

General QOL stuff with SQL, to make it more "friendly" for linux users.
Oh yeah we have SQL now by the way, it will retain message history and is a lot more secure with password locks and more.

PyQT client version is *almost* complete, and has now replaced the old tkinter version. The old version will show under "client_legacy".

# Known Issues

1.DM window on the main client once closed, does not open again. Fixing it right now.
2.CLI version is.... a work in progress. Ignore it.
3. Stuff looking kinda basic, styling will be added soon.
